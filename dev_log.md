   - Added comprehensive error handling and logging
   - Implemented automatic data directory creation
   - Created troubleshooting documentation

2. **Implemented Blueprint Architecture**
   - Refactored routes into three blueprints:
     - main_bp: Public-facing routes for browsing and reading
     - auth_bp: Authentication routes for login/registration
     - api_bp: API endpoints for programmatic access
   - Updated templates to use blueprint-prefixed URLs
   - Improved application factory pattern in __init__.py
   - Updated demo application to use the same blueprint structure

## Current Focus

### Priority: Open System Implementation

The current development focus has shifted to implementing an open system that allows for broader access and participation without requiring user accounts for basic functionality. This approach prioritizes:

1. **Public Access to Content**
   - Allow anonymous browsing and reading of all content
   - Implement open download capabilities without login requirements
   - Create public API endpoints for content discovery

2. **Contribution Mechanisms**
   - Design lightweight contribution workflows
   - Implement moderation queues for anonymous contributions
   - Create verification systems for content submissions

3. **Community Features**
   - Develop public commenting and annotation systems
   - Implement content rating and recommendation features
   - Create public collection/curation capabilities

User administration and account management features have been deprioritized in favor of this open-access approach.

## Next Steps

### Short-term (1-2 weeks)

1. **Open Access Implementation**
   - Remove login requirements from content access routes
   - Create public browsing and reading experiences
   - Implement open download functionality

2. **Content Import**
   - Finalize Standard Ebooks import functionality
   - Implement Project Gutenberg import with proper attribution
   - Add batch import capabilities
   - Create public import request system

3. **Community Features**
   - Implement public commenting system
   - Create content rating functionality
   - Develop public collection/curation tools

### Medium-term (1-2 months)

1. **Authentication System** (Deprioritized)
   - Complete user registration and login functionality
   - Implement password reset flow
   - Add role-based access control
   - Create user profile pages

2. **Testing and Deployment**
   - Develop comprehensive test suite
   - Set up continuous integration
   - Prepare for beta deployment
   - Create deployment documentation

## Technical Debt and Improvements

1. **Code Quality**
   - Add comprehensive test suite
   - Implement continuous integration
   - Improve code documentation
   - Refactor for better maintainability

2. **Security Enhancements**
