                    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                    <p>The Remixable Fiction Library aims to build a dynamic, "Wikipedia-style" reference library dedicated to freely available, easily accessible, and openly licensed novels and stories. We focus specifically on literary works whose copyright status permits remixing and the creation of derivative works.</p>
                    
                    <p>Our goal is to create a living collection, not merely a static archive, where classic and contemporary open narratives can be discovered, shared, adapted, and built upon by a global community.</p>

                    <h2>What Makes a Work "Remixable"?</h2>
                    <p>For a work to be considered "remixable" in our library, it must meet these criteria:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Free to access</strong>: Available online without paywalls or restrictions</li>
                        <li><strong>Available in full text</strong>: Complete works, not excerpts</li>
                        <li><strong>Legally remixable</strong>: Under a license that explicitly permits creating derivative works</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>We primarily include works that are:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>In the United States Public Domain (published before 1929)</li>
                        <li>Released under permissive Creative Commons licenses (CC0, CC BY, CC BY-SA)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Understanding Our Licenses</h2>
                    
                    <h5>Public Domain (US)</h5>
                    <p>Works published before 1929 are generally in the public domain in the United States. These works can be freely copied, modified, distributed, and performed, even for commercial purposes, without asking permission.</p>
                    
                    <h5>Creative Commons Zero (CC0)</h5>
                    <p>CC0 is a public domain dedication tool. The creator waives all copyright and related rights in their work, effectively placing it into the global public domain to the fullest extent possible under law.</p>
                    
                    <h5>Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY)</h5>
                    <p>This license allows others to copy, distribute, display, perform, and remix the work, even for commercial purposes, as long as they give attribution to the original creator in the manner specified.</p>
                    
                    <h5>Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike (CC BY-SA)</h5>
                    <p>This license allows the same freedoms as CC BY with two conditions: attribution must be given to the creator, and any derivative works created must be licensed under the same or a compatible ShareAlike license.</p>

                    <h2>Our Verification Process</h2>
                    <p>We take copyright and licensing seriously. Every work in our library undergoes a verification process:</p>
                    
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Source Verification</strong>: We verify that the work comes from a reliable source</li>
                        <li><strong>License Verification</strong>: We confirm the work's copyright status or open license</li>
                        <li><strong>Documentation</strong>: We record the verification process and results</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <p>Works from Standard Ebooks and Project Gutenberg are generally pre-verified, while works from other sources undergo more rigorous checks.</p>
